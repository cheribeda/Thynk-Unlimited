# Thynk Unlimited: A Proposal for Netflix’s Next Big Horror Trilogy

This project uses data science to pitch a new horror trilogy idea to Netflix based on trends in viewership, genre performance, and seasonal engagement with horror content.

## 📊 Overview

**Thynk Unlimited** aims to fill a content gap on Netflix by leveraging data from publicly available viewership sources. It explores whether Netflix should invest more in horror trilogies and presents a predictive case using comparative analytics with the *Fear Street* series and other high-performing horror titles.

## 📂 Project Components

- **Data Cleaning & Filtering**: Used genre keywords and manual validation to isolate horror content from Netflix global, country-specific, and "Most Popular" datasets.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualized genre engagement, top-performing horror titles, and top horror-viewing countries.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Estimated the performance of a hypothetical trilogy using past metrics from similar content.

## 📁 Data Sources

- Netflix Global Viewership Data  
- Netflix Country-Level Data  
- Netflix 91-Day Popularity Rankings

> All data is publicly accessible and sourced from Netflix viewership datasets made available via GitHub.

## 🧰 Tools Used

- **Languages**: Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Environment**: Jupyter Notebook
- **Libraries**: NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib

## 📉 Key Visualizations

- Total Weekly Hours Viewed by Horror Title
- Cumulative Weeks in Top 10
- Genre Comparison
- Seasonality Line Graph of Horror Engagement
- Projected Engagement for Proposed Trilogy

## 🔍 Ethical Considerations

- Data was publicly available and anonymized
- Manual genre validation ensured accurate classification
- Projections are illustrative, not definitive

## 📌 Recommendations

Netflix should consider investing in a new horror trilogy, especially releasing it during peak seasonal windows (e.g., October), and focus marketing in horror-heavy countries such as Malaysia and Thailand.
